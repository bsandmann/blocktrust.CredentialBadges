# Blocktrust Credential Badges

## Overview

Blocktrust Credential Badges is a project designed to enhance the display and verification of W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and OpenBadges 3.0 credentials on websites. Our goal is to create a system for embedding these credentials, making them accessible and verifiable for everyone, even without an identity wallet.

## Key Features

1. **Credential Embedding**: A module that enables embedding of W3C VCs and OpenBadges 3.0 credentials into any website.
2. **Verification Infrastructure**: A backend system that supports embedded credentials, ensuring their continued validity and authenticity.
3. **Interactive Verification**: Users can click on embedded credentials to access a detailed verification page.
4. **Credential Issuing Platform**: A platform for issuing Achievement Credentials and managing Endorsement Credential workflows.

## How It Works

The Blocktrust Credential Badges system operates in several steps:

1. **Credential Issuance**: Using our Blazor-based issuing platform, organizations can create and issue verifiable credentials to individuals.

2. **Embedding**: The credential holder receives a JavaScript snippet that can be embedded into their website. This snippet is responsible for displaying the credential badge.

3. **Verification**: When the embedded credential is loaded on a webpage, it makes a call to our backend service to verify its current validity status.

4. **User Interaction**: Visitors to the website can click on the embedded credential to view more details and see a full verification report.


## Project Timeline
