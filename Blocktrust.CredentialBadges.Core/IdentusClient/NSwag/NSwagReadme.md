# NSwag Readme
The IdentusClient was automatically generated using NSwagStudio 14.0.7.0
Link to NSwagStudio: https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/wiki/NSwagStudio

The settings used to generate the client are saved in the IdentusClient.nswag file.

The result is then copied to the IdentusClient.cs file.

The initial generation was based on Identus agent version 1.33.0
The OpenAPI specification was downloaded from the documentation page of the Identus agent:
https://docs.atalaprism.io/agent-api/ (These docs might move in the future)

Several fixes had to be applied to the generated code to make it compile. Those fixes reside
int eh IdentusClientFixes.cs folder and need to be improved gradually to cover the complete API.
