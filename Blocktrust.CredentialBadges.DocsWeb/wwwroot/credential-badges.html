Unlike traditional badges or review systems&mdash;which can easily become outdated, forged, or manipulated&mdash;Credential Badges leverages decentralized identifiers (DIDs), W3C Verifiable Credentials, and blockchain technology to ensure badges remain authentic, traceable, and continuously verifiable in real time.</p><p id="z9486f2_13">With Credential Badges, trusted entities such as universities, companies, certification bodies, or industry experts can publicly issue badges or endorsements, granting clear recognition of courses completed, sponsorships received, or verified trust statements. Website owners can then easily embed these badges on their pages using simple, customizable JavaScript snippets provided by the application. Visitors to these websites can instantly verify any badge&rsquo;s authenticity and current validity with a quick click, with no complicated setup or identity wallets required.</p><p id="z9486f2_14">The application is currently provided as a proof of concept, demonstrating how cryptographic verification can enhance the transparency and reliability of credentials shared online. While the project itself is essentially complete, its open-source nature invites exploration, experimentation, and further development by interested users and developers.</p><p id="z9486f2_15">Here is a brief overview of the main application in a video: <span class="control" id="z9486f2_18">TODO</span></p><p id="z9486f2_16">If you want to go through the steps of issuing a sample badge yourself, here is a simple <a href="step-by-step-guide.html" id="z9486f2_19" data-tooltip="This step-by-step guide provides a comprehensive overview of the application.

In 2024, Atala was cut back, leaving only a core team. The technical platform was rebranded as <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-identus/identus" id="z9486f2_31" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_33">Identus</span></a> and is now part of <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_32">Hyperledger</span>.</p><p id="z9486f2_23">Credential Badges was initially envisioned in 2022, revised, and submitted for voting in late 2023. While the core idea has stayed the same, some assumptions and, consequently, implementation concepts have changed over time. One core assumption was that the SSI ecosystem within the Cardano ecosystem would take off, given investments from IOG and product decisions from the <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_34">Atala</span> team. In particular, it was assumed that an SSI wallet would already be available, simplifying credential handling. While IOG had long planned to integrate SSI into <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_35">Lace</span> (the IOG browser wallet for the Cardano ecosystem), this still isn't the case as of March 2025.</p><p id="z9486f2_24">Consequently, we had to work with what was available within the Identus ecosystem. Several key decisions had to be made regarding how a credential would be created and what kind of credential this would be. We decided to split the project into two separate applications, which can be used together but also function independently.</p><p id="z9486f2_25">The main value proposition of the proposal was to transform an existing credential into something embeddable in a website while remaining verifiable. The first application achieves just that: a user can paste a credential into the application, and the app generates an embeddable HTML snippet. From a technical perspective, we decided to focus on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential" id="z9486f2_36" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec/blob/main/w3c-spec/PRISM-method.md" id="z9486f2_37" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_41">did:prism</span></a> as the issuer, since this is also generated by an [<span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_38">Identus cloud agent</span> ](https://github.com/hyperledger-identus/cloud-agent. Additionally, we extended the capability to support certain types of OpenBadge Credentials (3.0), as they are an extension of the W3C VC standard (Data Model 2.0). This served two purposes: primarily, it allowed us to use the data structure of OpenBadges, eliminating the need to invent our own schema for structuring the internal data (i.e., the <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_39">Credential Subject</span>) of the credential. Instead, we could rely on an established standard (<a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/" id="z9486f2_40" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">see OpenBadges 3.0 spec</a>).</p><p id="z9486f2_26">This decision has the side effect that the platform, in theory, can also embed <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/" id="z9486f2_42" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBadges 3.0</a> credentials not created with the <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_43">Identus cloud agent</span> or even with another DID method. To prove this point, we also partially support <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_44">did:key</span> and <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_45">did:web</span>. However, this may not work consistently with random OpenBadge-compatible credentials due to the wide range of schema variations, allowed DID methods, and cryptographic signatures that cannot be fully covered by this project. Implementing all variations would be far beyond this <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_46">proof-of-concept</span>.</p><p id="z9486f2_27">To ensure a reliable working concept, we created a second application dedicated to creating <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_47">did:prism</span>-based W3C Verifiable Credentials that are fully verifiable and, therefore, embeddable. While we could have used our custom implementation for issuing and signing credentials, we opted to build a solution specifically on top of the <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_48">Identus cloud agent</span>. This has the advantage that organizations already using the cloud agent can easily integrate our application into their infrastructure, providing a UI for issuing credentials to external parties. However, from a user perspective, the experience is less than optimal. The reason is that the <span class="emphasis" id="z9486f2_49">Identus cloud agent</span> is not an SDK, and issuing a credential&mdash;even for demo purposes&mdash;is a complex interaction between the &quot;issuer&quot; and the &quot;holder&quot; using a protocol called WACI, executed over a DIDComm connection. Both parties must be set up in the application as two agents that go through the issuance process. This is the main reason why we are not providing a single application; we consider the issuing application only as a workaround until more mature tooling or real production use cases for credential issuance emerge.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="project-structure" data-toc="project-structure">Project Structure</h2><p id="z9486f2_50">The project consists of two applications (see the explanation above):</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z9486f2_51"><li class="list__item" id="z9486f2_52"><p><span class="control" id="z9486f2_54">The Badges project (for embedding Verifiable Credentials)</span></p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z9486f2_55"><li class="list__item" id="z9486f2_56"><p>Can be used as a hosted instance (for demo and production use): <a href="https://badges.blocktrust.dev" id="z9486f2_58" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">badges.blocktrust.dev</a></p></li><li class="list__item" id="z9486f2_57"><p>Can be self-hosted; see <a href="how-to-run.html" id="z9486f2_59" data-tooltip="The simplest way to run the application is to use the provided hosted instances here and here.">How to run</a> or <a href="how-to-build.html" id="z9486f2_60" data-tooltip="This guide explains how to set up your development environment for building and running the Blocktrust.CredentialBadges.Builder and Blocktrust.CredentialBadges.Web projects.
